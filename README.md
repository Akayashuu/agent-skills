# agent-skills

A collection of **framework/language expert skills** for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) (and any agent runtime following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) spec).

Each skill is a concise, scannable reference of *idiomatic, modern best practices* — the judgment calls a linter can't make. They load on demand when a task matches their `description`.

## Install as a Claude Code plugin

Add this repo as a plugin marketplace, then install the plugin to get all 15 skills at once:

```
/plugin marketplace add Akayashuu/agent-skills
/plugin install agent-skills@expert-skills
```

Skills are discovered automatically and load on demand when a task matches their `description`. Update later with `/plugin marketplace update expert-skills`.

## Install manually

Copy the skills you want into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
# Claude Code (personal, all projects)
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# or per-project (committed with the repo)
cp -r skills/* .claude/skills/
```

Then ask Claude Code as usual — it loads the relevant skill when your task matches.
